# About Quarto

This tutorial will show you how Quarto reuses and rethinks the features of the R Markdown ecosystem, moving from several R packages to a single tool. 

Enhancing scientific publishing through Quarto is the workshop's focus, designed for those familiar with R Markdown and newcomers to Quarto. Quarto extends the foundational capabilities of R Markdown, introducing advanced features that elevate publishing projects. 

Quarto offers the reworked R Markdown functionalities (cross references, article layout, figure management, etc.) as well as multiple formats (HTML & PDF document, website, HTML presentation, etc.), and project management (Websites, Blogs, Books, ...) while adding new functionalities for greater flexibility and collaboration (easy modification of an HTML theme, extension mechanism, facilitated collaborative project, etc.).
