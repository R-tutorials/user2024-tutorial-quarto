## Projet Quarto ?

Quarto projects are **directories** that provide :

::: incremental
* a way to `render` all or part of the files in a directory using a single command (for example, `quarto render myproject`).
* A means of sharing YAML configuration between several documents.
* The ability to redirect output artifacts to another directory.
* The ability to freeze rendering (i.e. not re-run documents unless they have changed).
:::

## We've already created a project...

A project is a directory with a `_quarto.yml`, no matter how simple.

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml"}
project:
  title: "Quarto-101"
```

::: columns
::: {.column .fragment .fade-right width="50%"}
This is a Quarto Project.

![](images/quarto-project.png){fig-alt="Files panel in RStudio showing my-doc.qmd and _quarto.yml." width=80%}
:::

::: {.column .fragment .fade-left width="50%"}
This is not.

## Which projects can be created ?

Projects can have special "types" that introduce additional behavior (for example, websites or books).

``` bash
$ quarto create project
? Type
‚ùØ default
  website
  blog
  manuscript
  book
  confluence
```

## Quarto Website

- Websites are essentially `format: html` + a Quarto Project file
- But a website is different than `format: html` in that it has multiple pages

- Arbitrary depth and organization of content
- Multi-level navigation (navigation bar / sidebar / hybrid)
- Full-text search (client-side or Algolia)
- Freeze calculation results (`freeze` configuration)

## Quarto Website

``` {.yaml filename="_quarto.yml" code-line-numbers="|2|4-5|6-10|12-15"}
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "today"
  navbar:
    left:
      - href: index.qmd
        text: Home
      - about.qmd

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    toc: true
```

## Our turn

::: {.callout}

# Let's turn our project into a website

1. Add an `index.qmd` to your existing `Quarto-101` project with a `title` and some content.
2. Modify the `_quarto.yml` to make a website
3. Set a theme for our website
4. `quarto preview` to see website evolve
:::

## Your turn! 

```{r}
#| echo: false
countdown(minutes = 15)
```

::: {.callout}

# Turn your project into a website

1. Add navigation to display your `new-penguins.qmd` report in a submenu of the `navbar`
   1. Tips: Remove `theme` key at document level.
2. Customize your website configuration (theme, navbar, sidebar, ...)! 
3. Add more content like an [About page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html)

# Computations

## When should code be re-run? {#computations-rerun}

::: incremental
-   You might have a reason to re-run all code in a Quarto website (every single chunk in every single document) every time you render the website.

-   But, chances are, that's not what you want.

    -   Just playing around styling -- you probably don't want to run the code again

    -   Changed some code in a document -- you probably want to re-run the code in that document, but not necessarily others

    -   Made a big change affecting computations on many or all pages -- you probably want to re-run all code

-   `freeze` and `cache` options give you fine control over these decisions
:::

## Freeze

The `freeze` option controls when/if computational documents be re-rendered during a global project render:
  
```{.yaml style='margin-bottom: 1rem'}
execute:
  freeze: true  # never re-render during project render
```

```{.yaml style='margin-bottom: 1rem'}
execute:
  freeze: auto  # re-render only when source changes
```

```{.yaml style='margin-bottom: 1rem'}
execute:
  freeze: false  # always re-render (default)
```

## Freeze

-   The `freeze` option is typically added to a `_metadata.yml` file within a specific directory, affecting all files in that directory. [Shared Metadata](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/quarto-projects.html#shared-metadata)

-   It can also be set a root level for the whole website in `_quarto.yml`

-   You can have it only within specific subdirectories for more complex sites.

## Cache

- Quarto relies on computation engine's caching mechanism, i.e. for `engine: knitr` and R .qmd document, **knitr** caching mechanism is used.

- Cache stores the results of computations for a specific file.

- Cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code (or other cache attributes you've defined).

- `cache` can also be set at the chunk level. Consider using the cache for computationally expensive chunks.


## Freeze vs. cache {#freeze-cache-1}

- Freeze option is typically set

  - for the whole website in `_quarto.yml`, or

  - for files within a directory in `_metadata.yml` in that directory

``` yaml
execute: 
  freeze: auto
```

## Freeze vs. cache {#freeze-cache-2}

- Cache option is typically set for a given file or for individual chunk(s) in a file.

``` yaml
execute:
  cache: true
```

or

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| cache: true

1 + 1
```

## Our turn!

::: {.callout}

# Let's play with cache and freeze

1. Setting `freeze: true` and `freeze: auto`
2. Setting `cache: true` on computation cells
