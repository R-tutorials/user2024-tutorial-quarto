## Quarto is like R Markdown then

* If you know R Markdown, you should be able to find your way around! 

* Same principle & same foundation 

* Quarto = Markdown + execution result + Pandoc

## R Markdown is not archived

* A vast ecosystem with an active community,

* Still supported by Posit

* But... fewer new features, with a focus on Quarto

## Quarto CLI...

orchestrates each step of rendering

## Advantages to change

* Joint projects with Jupyter users

* Benefit from new features 

* Fresh new formats

::: notes 
I hope the tuto gave you an idea!

## No need to convert

* Change when starting a new project! 

* No point in converting old documents except for living content (personal blog, website, ...)

* Reminder: What works with R Markdown will continue to work!
