## Quarto is like R Markdown then

* If you know R Markdown, you should be able to find your way around! 

* Same principle & same foundation 

* Quarto = Markdown + execution result + Pandoc

## R Markdown is not archived

* A vast ecosystem with an active community,

* Still supported

* But... fewer new features, with a focus on Quarto

## Quarto CLI...

orchestrates each step of rendering

Illustrated by Allison Horst.](images/horst_qmd_render_schema.png){fig-alt="A schematic representing rendering of Quarto documents from .qmd, to knitr or jupyter, to plain text markdown, then converted by pandoc into any number of output types including html, PDF, or Word document."}


## Advantages to change

* Joint projects with Jupyter users

* Benefit from new features 

* Fresh new formats

::: notes 
I hope the tuto gave you an idea! 
:::

## No need to convert

* Change when starting a new project or on python / julia collaboration project!

* No point in converting old documents except for regularly updated content maybe (personal blog, website, ...)

* Reminder: What works with R Markdown should continue to work!

## Getting help

* Review the FAQ: <https://quarto.org/docs/faq>

* Have a question, post on GitHub Discussion : <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/>

* Found (or think you found) a bug, open an issue: <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues>

## Getting help

::: {.callout-tip}

## Troubleshooting: Creating a minimum reproducible example

- For any coding question, start by creating a minimum reproducible example (reprex)

- You'll find that this task is less than trivial for a complex Quarto project

- But there's a good chance you'll solve your problem while creating the reprex
  
- Otherwise, a non miniaml reproducible is a start!
